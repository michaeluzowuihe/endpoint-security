## Packet Tracer Activities And Labs
### Logical and Physical Mode Exploration
#### In this activity, I achieved the the following primary objectives:
1. Investigated Devices in the Wiring Closet
2. Connected End Devices to Networking Devices
3. Installed a Backup Router
4. Configured the Hostname
5. Explored the Rest of the Network

### Investigate a Threat Landscape
#### In this activity, I investigated three vulnerabilities that can be exploited by threat actors.
1. Investigated a Network Configuration Vulnerability
   - Used a guest network to gain access to other devices on the network.
   - Explored the Home network to identify the vulnerability.
2. Investigated a Phishing Malware Vulnerability
   - Posed as a threat actor and created a phishing email.
   - Opened the emails received from the threat actor.
   - Posed as a victim and followed the phishing instructions.
3. Investigated a Wireless Network and DNS Vulnerability
   - Connected to the threat actorâ€™s wireless network.
   - Visited a favorite social media site.
   - Investigated the source of the attack.
