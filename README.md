# Endpoint Security

## Packet Tracer Activities

### Logical and Physical Mode Exploration
1. Investigated Devices in the Wiring Closet
2. Connected End Devices to Networking Devices
3. Installed a Backup Router
4. Configured the Hostname
5. Explored the Rest of the Network

### Investigate a Threat Landscape
1. Investigated a Network Configuration Vulnerability
   - Used a guest network to gain access to other devices on the network
   - Explored the Home network to identify the vulnerability
2. Investigated a Phishing Malware Vulnerability
   - Posed as a threat actor and created a phishing email
   - Opened the emails received from the threat actor
   - Posed as a victim and followed the phishing instructions
3. Investigated a Wireless Network and DNS Vulnerability
   - Connected to the threat actorâ€™s wireless network
   - Visited a favourite social media site
   - Investigated the source of the attack

### Configure Basic Wireless Security
1. Verified connectivity
2. Configured basic wireless security
3. Updated the wireless settings on Laptop

### Troubleshoot a Wireless Connection
At a local library, the librarian learns that a patron is unable to access the internet on one of the laptops. All the computers are configured with DHCP IP addressing except for the wireless user on Laptop1, who is complaining that www.cisco.pka cannot be reached. So, I practised my troubleshooting skills utilizing this file (https://drive.google.com/file/d/13ZywtU1TbQhCY1KZG92cR-ES_TN4MTiP/view?usp=sharing):
1. Identified faults in the wireless network
2. Corrected misconfigured devices in the wireless network
3. Verified the resolution

### Access Control List (ACL) Demonstration
1. Verified Local Connectivity and Test Access Control List
   - Pinged devices on the local network to verify connectivity
   - Ping devices on remote networks to test ACL functionality
2. Removed Access Control List and Repeat Test
   - Used show commands to investigate the ACL configuration
   - Removed access-list 11 from the configuration
